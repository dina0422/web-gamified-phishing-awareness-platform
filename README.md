PhishProof 2.0 is a culturally-adaptive, web-gamified phishing awareness training platform designed specifically for Malaysian users. Unlike traditional static training methods, PhishProof employs an immersive 2D top-down RPG-style interface where users navigate authentic digital environments, interact with NPCs, and make real-time decisions that impact their security awareness scores.
